# How to Use PyPRS
This section provides instructions for running PyPRS on a **single computer** and a **cluster**.

## 1 üñ•Ô∏è Running PyPRS on a Single Computer <a name="h1"></a>
To run PyPRS on a single computer, users just need to execute the **`GUI.py`** file located in the `UserInterface` package in a Python environment. Once the file is executed, the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** will launch. In the GUI, users can:
- **select a procedure**
- **configure input parameters**
- **upload required files**
- **run the procedure**

Below is a screenshot of the GUI:

### 1.1 Setting Up a Built-in Procedure
To use a built-in procedure (e.g., GSP, KT, PASS, or FBKT), follow these steps:

#### 1) Configuring Input Parameters
Each procedure requires specific input parameters.  For detailed explanations of the input parameters for each procedure, please go to <a name="IP" href="./Input Parameters.md">Input Parameters</a>.

#### 2) Uploading Required Files
In addition to configuring parameters, users must upload two files: one is the **alternatives infromation file** (a **`.txt`** file) and the other one is the **simulation function file** (a **`.py`** file). For detailed discussions about these two files, please go to <a name="UF" href="./Uploading Files.md">Uploading Files</a>.



### 1.2 Setting Up a Custom Procedure
To use a custom procedure, follow these steps:

#### 1) Configuring Input Parameters
Below is a screenshot of the GUI for the custom procedure:

  <img width="379.52" height="396.8" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a3ab001-4d6a-4873-bb6a-90c63e7696a4" />


When configuring a custom procedure, there are two default input parameters that need to be set:

- **`Number of Processors`**: Number of processors used to run the procedure.
- **`Repeat`**: Number of times the problem is repeatedly solved.

In addition to these two default input parameters, users can define other custom input parameters based on their procedure's requirements.

#### 2) Uploading Required Files

When using a custom procedure, users also need to upload the **alternatives infromation file** and the **simulation function file**. Besides these two files, users must upload a **procedure file** (a **`.py`** file). In this file, users must define a function named `custom_procedure`, which implements the computational steps for one run of the custom procedure.  For detailed discussions about the file, please go to <a href="./Procedure File.md" name="PF">Procedure File</a>.
## 2 üåê Running PyPRS on a Cluster
Running PyPRS on a cluster follows a process similar to running it on a single computer, with additional steps to configure the cluster and ensure proper communication among the computers. Note that **deploying a Ray cluster is supported only on Linux**.
### 2.1 Setting Up the Ray Cluster
To establish a Ray cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Designate a Head Node**: Choose one computer as the head node to coordinate the cluster.
2. **Initialize the Head Node**: On the head node, run the following command in the terminal to start the Ray cluster:
```bush
ray start --head --port=6379
```
3. **Connect Worker Nodes**: On each of the other computers (worker nodes), run the following command to connect to the head node, replacing `HEAD_NODE_IP` with the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the head node:
```bush
ray start --address=HEAD_NODE_IP:6379
```
### 2.2 Running PyPRS on the Cluster
After setting up the Ray cluster, users can run PyPRS on the head node using the same process described in <a href="#h1">**Running PyPRS on a Single Computer**</a>. 
## üìñ Notes

PyPRS enables users to run procedures via scripts, alongside the GUI. This supports varied user needs and allows easy integration into automated workflows or complex computational pipelines.
