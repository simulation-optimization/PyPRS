# The Throughput Maximization Problem

## 1 üìù Problem Description
The throughput maximization problem considers a flow line system with three stations, labeled as Stations 1, 2, and 3. There are infinitely many jobs waiting in front of Station 1, and each job moves sequentially through all three stations. The service times at Stations 1, 2, and 3 are independently drawn from exponential distributions with service rates $s_1$, $s_2$, and $s_3$ respectively. At Stations 2 and 3, there is finite buffer storage, denoted as $b_2$ and $b_3$ respectively. When the buffer at Station $i$, where $i = 2, 3$, is fully occupied, Station $i - 1$ is blocked and must hold the completed job until the job at Station $i$ is finished and released. The objective of this problem is to determine the optimal allocation of the service rate and the buffer to maximize the expected steady-state throughput of the flow line subject to constraints $s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = \mathcal{L}_1$,  $b_2 + b_3 = \mathcal{L}_2$, and $x=(s_1,s_2,s_3,b_2,b_3)\in Z$. Here, $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$ represent problem-specific parameters that define the feasible solution set. The mathematical formulation of this problem is as follows:

<p align="center">$\max_{x} \mathbb{E}[f(x; \xi)]$</p>
<p align="center">$\text{s.t.} \quad s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = \mathcal{L}_1$</p>
<p align="center">$\quad\quad b_2 + b_3 = \mathcal{L}_2 $</p>
<p align="center">$\quad\quad\quad  x=(s_1,s_2,s_3,b_2,b_3)\in Z$,</p>

where $f(x; \xi)$ is the random throughput of the flow line. For every feasible solution, we obtain observations of $f(x; \xi)$ by running simulation experiments. For each simulation experiment, we warm up the system with 2,000 jobs. After 2,000 jobs are processed, we observe the throughput of the subsequent 50 jobs. In this demonstration, we let $\mathcal{L}_1=50$ and $\mathcal{L}_2=50$ resulting in 57,624 alternatives available in the problem.

*Note*: When the number of alternatives for a problem is very large, manually creating the **alternatives information file** can be time-consuming. In this problem, we use a <a href="https://github.com/simulation-optimization/PyPRS/raw/refs/heads/main/files/Generate%20Alternatives%20Information%20File.zip">Python function</a> to automatically generate the **alternatives information file**. Users can make slight modifications to this function to generate the file for other problems.




### 2.1 GSP
The screenshot below displays the PyPRS GUI during GSP execution:

After using GSP to solve the problem, the results are summarized in the table below, which reports the Probability of Correct Selection (PCS), Total Simulation Time (s), Total Sample Size, Wall-Clock Time (s), Utilization, and the 95% confidence intervals for the five metrics. Note that when calculating the PCS, if the mean of the selected best alternative is within $\delta$ to that of the true best alternative, we count it as a correct selection.

Note that for the PASS procedure, we report the average mean of the surviving alternatives instead of the PCS, as multiple alternatives may remain when the procedure terminates.

### 2.5 The Custom Procedure

In this demo application, when implementing the custom procedure, we consider the equal allocation procedure. The procedure takes two additional input parameters, total sampling budget `N` and `Reference Seed`, in addition to `Repeat` and `Number of Processors`. The selection structure of the procedure is straightforward. At the start of the selection process, based on the total sampling budget set by the users, the procedure evenly allocates the simulation budget across all alternatives. Then, the alternatives are evenly distributed to all processors. Each processor generates simulation samples from the assigned alternatives, and the alternative with the highest sample mean is selected as the best.
